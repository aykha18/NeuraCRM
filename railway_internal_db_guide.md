# Railway Internal Database Configuration

## 🎯 Correct Approach for Railway Database Connection

You're absolutely right - we should use the **internal Railway database URL**, not the public one. Railway provides internal environment variables for secure database connections.

## 🔧 Internal Railway Database Variables

Railway automatically provides these internal environment variables:

```bash
# PostgreSQL Internal Variables (Railway provides these automatically)
PGHOST=internal_host
PGPORT=internal_port  
PGUSER=postgres
PGPASSWORD=internal_password
PGDATABASE=railway

# Or the combined internal DATABASE_URL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:internal_password@internal_host:internal_port/railway
```

## 📋 Steps to Fix Railway Deployment

### Option 1: Check Current Railway Environment Variables
The Railway app should automatically have access to internal database variables. Check if these are set:

1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Service Settings
2. Check Environment Variables tab
3. Look for:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (internal)
   - `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`

### Option 2: Use Railway CLI to Check Variables
```bash
railway variables
```

### Option 3: Check Railway Service Logs
```bash
railway logs
```

## 🔍 What to Look For

The Railway app should be using an internal URL like:
```
postgresql://postgres:internal_password@internal_host:5432/railway
```

**NOT** the public URL we were using:
```
postgresql://postgres:irUsikIqAifdrCMNOlGtApioMQJDjDfE@nozomi.proxy.rlwy.net:49967/railway
```

## 🚨 Current Issue

The Railway app is likely:
1. **Missing** the internal `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
2. **Using** a default/empty database configuration
3. **Not connected** to any database at all

## ✅ Solution

1. **Check Railway Dashboard** for internal database variables
2. **Ensure** `DATABASE_URL` is set to the internal Railway database URL
3. **Redeploy** the service if needed
4. **Test** the connection

## 🎯 Expected Internal URL Format

Railway internal URLs typically look like:
```
postgresql://postgres:auto_generated_password@internal_host:5432/railway
```

The key difference is:
- **Internal**: Uses Railway's internal network
- **Public**: Uses external proxy (what we were using incorrectly)
