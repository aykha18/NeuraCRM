## ⚠️ Customer Churn Prediction

### What It Does

Identifies customers who are likely to stop doing business with you based on engagement patterns, deal history, and activity levels.

### Risk Scoring System

- **Low Risk (0-39 points)**: Standard engagement

#### **Risk Factors Analyzed**

1. **Activity Patterns**
   - No activity for 30+ days = +30 points
   - Low activity (14-30 days) = +15 points
   - No recent activity = +50 points

2. **Deal History**
   - No recent deals = +20 points
   - High deal loss rate (>50%) = +25 points

3. **Lead Engagement**
   - No recent leads = +15 points
